Web Fluency Map (v1.1)
==========================

This is a touchstone repo to serve as a kicking off place to define what it means to be "fluent" in open web ethos. **It is in development**

3 Strands
==========================

The strands were developed in parallel with the organization of "Teach Like Mozilla" content. [Read this post](http://www.zythepsary.com/techie/open-fluency/) to understand the reasonings.

**Understanding** is designed to get learners **understanding the pedagogies and theoretical frameworks** behind how we Teach Like Mozilla. At the same time, learners explore the Web as an ecosystem. Since Teach Like Mozilla is designed for an intermediate web literate audience certain prerequisite skills can be expected (e.g. Accessing the web using the common features of web browsers”).

**Modeling** will help learners begin **building and establishing processes** and content that they will then use to teach the web to their individual audiences or work with collaborators. This section will also help them **playtest and refine** processes, content. Finally, this section will present **practicalities of resourcing, promotion and creation**.

**Uniting** is all about **connecting** people to their **local** community as well as the **global** community. Learners will use **real world, offline strategies** to sustain local activity, develop strong communities and learn to connect globally to better their own practice and the practice of others.
