Open Web Leadership Map (v1.1)
==========================

This is a touchstone repo to serve as a kicking off place to define what it means to be a leader in the Mozilla context. Open Web Leadership is the skills and competencies needed for teaching, organizing and sustaining learning for the Web. **It is in development** 

2 Strands (under constant iteration!)
==========================

We are developing this in parallel with the organization of "[Teach Like Mozilla](http://laurahilliger.gitbooks.io/teach-like-mozilla/)" content. [Read this post](http://www.zythepsary.com/techie/open-fluency/) to understand the reasonings. This [tag search](http://www.zythepsary.com/tag/methods-and-theories/) pulls up the most recent posts on this topic. Since Teach Like Mozilla is designed for an intermediate web literate audience certain prerequisite skills can be expected (e.g. Accessing the web using the common features of web browsers”).

**Facilitating** will help learners begin **understanding the pedagogies and theoretical frameworks, as well as build processes** and content that they will then use to teach the web to their individual audiences or work with collaborators. At the same time, learners explore the Web as an ecosystem.  This section will also help them **playtest and refine** processes, content. Finally, this section will present **practicalities of resourcing, promotion and creation**.

**Uniting** is all about **connecting** people to their **local** community as well as the **global** community. Learners will use **real world, offline strategies** to sustain local activity, develop strong communities and learn to connect globally to better their own practice and the practice of others.
